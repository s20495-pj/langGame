Better late than never
Where there is a will there is a way
Time heals all wounds
Time is money
Easier said than done
Speech is silver silence is golden
Nothing venture nothing gain
Never judge a book by its cover
All roads lead to Rome
Knowledge is power
Doing is better than saying
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Keep your friends close and enemies closer
A picture is worth a thousand words
There is no place like home
There is no time like the present
Two heads are better than one
A friend in need is a friend indeed
All is fair in love and war
Better safe than sorry
Do not talk the talk if you can not walk the walk
If you do not have anything nice to say do not say anything at all
If you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem
Piece of cake
Strike while the iron is hot
Honesty is the best policy
Do not bite the hand that feeds you
Actions speak louder than words
Curiosity killed the cat
My hands are tied
